## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MySQL 8.0
- Redis 6.2

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/commerceguard.git
   cd commerceguard
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. Access the services:
   - Website Registry: http://localhost:8081
   - Monitoring Service: http://localhost:8082
   - Data Pipeline: http://localhost:8083

## Configuration

### Database Configuration

Configure MySQL connection in `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/commerceguard
    username: ${MYSQL_USER:root}
    password: ${MYSQL_PASSWORD:root}
```

### Monitoring Configuration

Adjust thread pool sizes in `WebsiteMonitoringService`:

```java
private final ExecutorService monitoringPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(20);
private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(5);
```

## API Documentation

### Website Registry API

- `POST /api/v1/websites` - Register a new website
- `GET /api/v1/websites` - List all websites
- `GET /api/v1/websites/{id}` - Get website details
